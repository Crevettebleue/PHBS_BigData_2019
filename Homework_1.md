Big Data and the Gobi Desert invasion in China
PHBS – BIG DATA ANALYSIS

Context:
	The Gobi Desert blankets nearly 500,000 miles of northern China and southern Mongolia in dry, arid land. It is the fastest growing desert on Earth, transforming nearly 2,250 miles of grassland per year into inhospitable wasteland. This expansion eats away at space that was once fit for agriculture and creates unbridled sandstorms that batter cities near the edge of the desert. The rapid desertification of China’s northern regions poses an acute risk to the country and its people. (Forbes, 2017). 
  From both an economical & environmental perspective, monitoring the growth of the desert is therefore a priority for China as a nation as it enables to identify what are the key factors of expansion, which zones are at risk and predict when the desertification of theses zones will arise and ultimately predicting human migration flow. Accordingly, how can we leverage Big Data to monitor the growth of the Gobi Desert. 
  
  In order to solve this problem, we require a substantial amount of information. Specifically, we will require geospatial data. The datasets are made availed by the Copernicus Program, the European Union's Earth Observation Programme, looking at our planet and its environment for the ultimate benefit of all citizens. It offers vast amounts of global data from satellites and from ground-based, airborne and seaborne measurement systems (https://www.copernicus.eu/en/about-copernicus). Not all data from the Copernicus program is useful, and for this project, we posit that 3 out of the 6 branches of services of Copernicus are relevant: The Copernicus Climate Change Service, The Copernicus Land Monitoring Service. This allows us to gather imagery and reference data (near-real time), monitoring of biophysical parameter (periodic, 10 days), Solar radiation (periodic), etc… 
  Given what we mentioned, we can assume that the Velocity criterion of Big data is fulfilled. Additionally, As Geospatial data can be presented into 3 distinct categories: raster data, vector data and graph data, we can then assert that the Variety criteria is satisfied.  Finally, regarding Volume, our project requires the monitoring of a desert and its surrounding area that covers more than 500 000mi^2. Assuming we separate our surface area in boxes of 1 square miles, any additional variable that we implement to our analysis a drastically increase the volume and the size of our dataset. Since the Volume, Velocity and Variety criteria are satisfied. In an all, the intention of our project is to “Track” the advance of the Gobi Desert. To a smaller scale, it is not significantly different than tracking the movement a single animal. Accordingly, we posit the following workflow:

1. Collect and gather Data => 
2. Map data in 1 square mile cluster, changing over time => 
3. [Examine Data => Pre-process data if necessary (transform, decluster, etc.)]=>
4. Predict if the next non-desert square mile will become a desert soon =>
5. Check if the model produces reasonable results for the desert’s movement =>
6. If yes, use the model, otherwise, repeat at step 1 to 3

Regarding the way we are storing data, the five most popular way to store data are the following: Relational Databases, Key-Value Databases, Graph Databases Time Series Databases, and Document oriented Databases. First of all, as satellite images and the scientific data employed in our project are unstructured data by nature as well as being fairly voluminous, we can rule out the usage of relational database. Following this, Graph databases, does not cater our needs as highlighting potential relationship between nodes is not our priority. The question now remains between Document oriented Databases and Time Series Database. Both have their own advantages given our problem.
Document oriented database may ease up the clustering and characterisation of each square mile of our deserts and its surrounding, allowing us to monitor if a cluster is a desert or not. However, following this approach hinders the evolutionary aspect of our problem as we are deliberately omitting the dimension of time that characterize our problem since document-oriented databases have a hard time handling voluminous time series data. According to our previous points, it then becomes clear that a Time Serie database will offer the most optimal storage space to procced on the analysis of our data, are time is the central component of our analysis regarding the rate of growth of the Gobi Desert.
